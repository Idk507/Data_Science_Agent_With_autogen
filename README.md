# Data_Science_Agent_With_autogen

 **“AutoDS: A Multi‑Agent Data Science & Analytics Platform”** built on Autogen + Azure AI Services. It splits the end‑to‑end pipeline into specialized agents, each responsible for one stage—from raw data to deployable model and insights.

---

## 1. High‑Level Architecture & Workflow  
1. **Orchestrator Agent**  
   - Central “director” that sequences tasks, routes data/artifacts, aggregates logs & errors.  
   - Invokes sub‑agents based on pipeline stage and dependencies.  

2. **Data Ingestion Agent**  
   - Connects to data sources (CSV, SQL, Azure Data Lake).  
   - Validates schema & sample counts.  
   - Stores raw snapshot in Azure Blob Storage.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Agent**  
   - Generates summary statistics via pandas and Azure ML DataPrep.  
   - Creates visualizations (histograms, correlation heatmaps) using matplotlib in a code‑exec sandbox.  
   - Produces an “EDA Report” summary with Azure OpenAI for natural‑language interpretation.

4. **Data Cleaning Agent**  
   - Detects missing values/outliers.  
   - Suggests imputation or removal strategies via Autogen’s “chain‑of‑thought” prompts.  
   - Applies transformations and version‑controls cleaned data.

5. **Feature Engineering Agent**  
   - Recommends feature creation (polynomials, encodings, embeddings).  
   - Executes transformations (One‑Hot, scaling) and evaluates feature importance with a quick RandomForest.

6. **Model Selection & Training Agent**  
   - Spins up Azure ML pipelines.  
   - Tries multiple algorithms (e.g., LinearModels, Tree‑based, AutoML).  
   - Logs metrics to Azure ML Experiment Tracker.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning Agent**  
   - Uses Azure ML’s HyperDrive or custom Bayesian optimizer.  
   - Iterates on top‑n configurations; reports best trial.

8. **Evaluation & Validation Agent**  
   - Runs cross‑validation, computes metrics (accuracy, RMSE, AUC).  
   - Checks fairness, data drift via Azure ML ModelGuardrails.  
   - Summarizes results and flags potential issues.

9. **Explainability Agent**  
   - Leverages SHAP or LIME in a secure sandbox.  
   - Generates per‑feature SHAP plots and plain‑English explanations via Azure OpenAI.

10. **Report & Dashboard Agent**  
    - Assembles final analysis: narrative summary, key charts, top features, model performance.  
    - Publishes to Azure Power BI or exports a Markdown/HTML report.

11. **Deployment & Monitoring Agent**  
    - Wraps model in an Azure Container Instance or Function.  
    - Sets up endpoint, generates test calls.  
    - Configures monitoring: latency, error rates, prediction drift.

12. **Memory & Knowledge Agent**  
    - Archives artifacts (data snapshots, models, reports) in Azure Cognitive Search or Cosmos DB.  
    - Answers retrospective queries: “What was last month’s best model?”

## 3. Multi‑Agent Collaboration Patterns

- **Pipeline Chain**: Orchestrator calls each agent in sequence, passing outputs as inputs.  
- **Swarm/Ensemble**: Multiple modeling agents run in parallel; Orchestrator aggregates their metrics.  
- **Controller‑Worker**: A “Controller” Agent delegates mini‑tasks (e.g., feature subsets) to multiple Feature Engineering Agents.  
- **Conversational Interface**: Front‑end Agent that lets analysts ask questions (“Show me feature importances”), routed to Memory & Explainability Agents.

## 4. Getting Started

1. **Define Agent Interfaces**: With Autogen, write JSON/YAML descriptors for each agent’s inputs, outputs, and tools.  
2. **Bootstrap a Minimal MVP**:  
   - Build Ingestion → EDA → Reporting chain.  
   - Use Azure OpenAI to generate EDA commentary.  
3. **Iterate & Expand**: Add Cleaning, Feature, Modeling agents one by one—test each in isolation first.  
4. **Wire up Azure ML**: Containerize training code; register models and metrics.  
5. **Deploy Orchestrator**: Host on Azure Functions or Kubernetes, using Autogen’s orchestration APIs.
